# Idea
Being a fresh graduate, one of my current goals is to upgrade my CV. If I'm to have a career in web development, it's only natural to have a digital CV. It's the most persuasive and self-explanatory way to showcase my skills as a web developer.


# Future Work 
this is just a draft. In the future I need to change the CV card to look more realistic and add more containers inside for each section of the CV.
